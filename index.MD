## Welcome

Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase projects in Kubernetes and Terraform for cloud infrastructure, automation, and network monitoring.

## Project Overview

### Kubernetes Cluster for Network Monitoring
This project involves deploying a Kubernetes cluster to capture, monitor, and visualize network traffic using Prometheus and Grafana. The system is designed for real-time metrics visualization and secure access through NGINX.

- **Technologies Used:** Kubernetes, Docker, NGINX, Prometheus, Grafana, Ansible
- [View Kubernetes Project Details](/kubernetes-portfolio/architecture.md)
- [View Kubernetes Configurations](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/prenticesolutions/PrenticeSolutions.github.io/tree/main/kubernetes-portfolio/configs)

### Terraform Infrastructure Automation (Coming Soon)
An upcoming project focused on automating infrastructure deployments using Terraform on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This project will showcase cloud automation and scalability techniques using infrastructure as code.

- **Technologies Used:** Terraform, GCP, Ansible
- Detailed project information and code will be available soon!

## Future Enhancements

- Kubernetes project expansion with CI/CD pipeline integration and advanced alerting systems using Jenkins and Alertmanager.
- Terraform automation projects for cloud infrastructure deployment and management on GCP.

Stay tuned for more updates on my Terraform portfolio and enhancements to the Kubernetes project!
