Setup and Installation
----------------------

### Q: How do I clone the repository?

A: You can clone the repository using Git, GitHub Desktop, or VS Code integration. Full instructions can be found in the [Setup Guide](setup.html).

### Q: How do I access the Kubernetes Dashboard?

A: To access the Kubernetes Dashboard, use the following command:

    kubectl proxy

Then open your browser and go to:

    http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/

### Q: Why is my Grafana dashboard not loading?

A: Ensure that you have port-forwarding set up for Grafana using the following command:

    kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80

If it still doesn’t load, verify that the Grafana pod is running and the port-forward is active.

Monitoring and Metrics
----------------------

### Q: How do I monitor network traffic?

A: Network traffic is captured by the `traffic-collector` pod using `tcpdump`. Prometheus scrapes metrics from the collector and backup pods, and Grafana visualizes these metrics.

### Q: How do I add new monitoring targets to Prometheus?

A: To add new targets to Prometheus, update the `prometheus-config.yml` file by adding a new `job_name` under `scrape_configs` with the new target's address.

Troubleshooting
---------------

### Q: What should I do if a pod fails to start?

A: Check the logs of the failed pod using the following command:

    kubectl logs 

This will provide insights into why the pod isn’t starting. It could be due to incorrect configurations, missing images, or insufficient resources.

### Q: What happens if the Persistent Volume is full?

A: If the persistent volume becomes full, you may need to either expand the volume or rotate the data by backing up older data to another storage and freeing up space. You can also increase the `capacity` in the persistent volume configuration.

### Q: How do I restart a service or pod?

A: To restart a pod, you can delete it, and Kubernetes will automatically restart it based on the deployment settings. Use this command to delete a pod:

    kubectl delete pod 

Future Enhancements
-------------------

### Q: What new features are planned for this project?

A: Future enhancements include integrating Jenkins for automated CI/CD pipeline, adding more monitoring metrics to Prometheus, and scaling the cluster based on network traffic.

### Q: How can I contribute to this project?

A: You can contribute by forking the repository, making your changes, and submitting a pull request on GitHub. Be sure to check the [Changelog](changelog.html) for recent updates and the [Roadmap](roadmap.html) page for upcoming features. Also check my [Contact](contact.html) page to get in touch with me!

Future Enhancements and Roadmap
===============================

This page outlines the planned enhancements and roadmap for the Kubernetes-based network monitoring cluster. Each enhancement is designed to improve functionality, automation, and security in a phased approach.

Planned Enhancements
--------------------

### 1\. Alerting and Transition to Efficient Traffic Capture (30 days)

*   Integrate **Alertmanager** to notify on various types of network, pod, cluster, and security issues.
*   Replace the existing traffic-collector pod with **sFlow** for more efficient network traffic capture.

### 2\. Jenkins Integration (90 days)

**Goal:** Automate the process of creating pods and updating configurations of existing pods using Jenkins.

### 3\. Database Pod Exploration (180 days)

**Goal:** Investigate the efficiency of using a dedicated database pod (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) for storing network traffic data compared to the current traffic backup pod.

### 4\. Enhancing Security (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Continuously improve the security of the cluster. Review NGINX configurations for vulnerabilities and automate security checks.

Roadmap Timeline
----------------

### Phase 1: Alerting & sFlow (30 Days)

Complete the integration of Alertmanager and replace traffic-collector pod with sFlow.

### Phase 2: Jenkins Integration (90 Days)

Automate pod creation and configuration management with Jenkins.

### Phase 3: DB Pod Exploration (180 Days)

Explore the efficiency of using a database pod for storing network traffic data.

### Ongoing: Security Enhancements

Continuously improve security, starting with NGINX vulnerability checks.
