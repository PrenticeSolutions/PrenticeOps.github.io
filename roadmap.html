        <h1>Future Enhancements and Roadmap</h1>
        <p>This page outlines the planned enhancements and roadmap for the Kubernetes-based network monitoring cluster. Each enhancement is designed to improve functionality, automation, and security in a phased approach.</p>

        <h2>Planned Enhancements</h2>

        <h3>1. Alerting (30 days)</h3>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Integrate Alertmanager to notify on various types of network, pod, cluster, and security issues.</p>

        <h3>2. Jenkins Integration (90 days)</h3>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Automate the process of creating pods and updating configurations of existing pods using Jenkins. This will improve the speed and consistency of configuration management.</p>

        <h3>3. Database Pod Exploration (180 days)</h3>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Investigate the efficiency of using a dedicated database pod (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) for storing network traffic data compared to the current traffic backup pod.</p>

        <h3>4. Enhancing Security (Ongoing)</h3>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Continuously improve the security of the cluster. Initial steps include reviewing NGINX configurations for vulnerabilities and potentially automating security checks. Further security enhancements will be explored as the project evolves.</p>

        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <p>The roadmap below shows the planned timeline for each enhancement phase:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phase 1 (30 days):</strong> Complete the integration of Alertmanager for comprehensive alerting on network and security issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 2 (90 days):</strong> Implement Jenkins for pod creation and configuration management automation.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 3 (180 days):</strong> Explore and potentially implement a database pod for more efficient data storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Continue enhancing security by identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ul>
